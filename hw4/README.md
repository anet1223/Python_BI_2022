==================
This script contains several numpy functions.


*matrix_multiplication* - takes two arrays and return matrix multiplication.
*multiplication_check* - takes list of arrays and return True if they could be matrix multiply and False otherwise.
*multiply_matrices* - takes list of arrays and matrix multiply them if possible.
*compute_2d_distance* - takes 2 coordinates in two 1-dimention arrays and return distance between them.
*compute_multidimensional_distance* - takes multiply coordinates in two 1-dimention arrays and return distance between them.
*compute_pair_distances* - takes two-dimantion array and compute pair distance between columns and rows.
*if __name__ == "__main__"* - contains 3 variants of creating arrays in numpy.
